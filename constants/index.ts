      "Since graduating, I have worked in non-profit settings, sliding scale clinics, private practice settings seeing individuals and couples, and clinics working with workerâ€™s compensation patients, high functioning adults, and with healthcare workers. Some of my experience includes helping people with perfectionism, stress management, burnout management, depression, anxiety, relationships problems, improving communication, life transition issues, and healing PTSD. I have also coached professional athletes to improve sport performance through identifying beliefs that may hamper sport performance. I have helped them improve concentration skills and identify what they can control such as their attitude about stressors.",
