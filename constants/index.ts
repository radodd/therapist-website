Gen’s advice and assistance worked; I won my first event after working with her. I also had my lowest ever season scoring average. Gen’s practical but simple approach to sport psychology really helped me as it kept things simple. It allowed me a framework to use under pressure and it became the foundation to my on-course routine.",

As founder/CEO of a fast growing tech company valued in nine figures, and juggling a spouse and three kids under 13, I was not taking care of myself and the wear was showing. Most impressively, Gen set specific goals for us to END therapy, rather than continue indefinitely. As a CEO, I appreciated clear goal setting, such as how to know if I was responding rather than just reacting to the inevitable challenges. We achieved those goals, declared victory, and stopped therapy. I bet you have never done that with a therapist. Gen is the best.",
