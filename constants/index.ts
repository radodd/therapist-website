Some of my experience includes helping people with perfectionism, stress management, burnout management, depression, anxiety, relationships problems, improving communication, life transition issues, and healing PTSD. I have also coached professional athletes to improve sport performance through identifying beliefs that may hamper sport performance. I have helped them improve concentration skills and identify what they can control such as their attitude about stressors.",

Gen’s advice and assistance worked; I won my first event after working with her.  I also had my lowest ever season scoring average.  Gen’s practical but simple approach to sport psychology really helped me as it kept things simple.  It allowed me a framework to use under pressure and it became the foundation to my on-course routine.",
